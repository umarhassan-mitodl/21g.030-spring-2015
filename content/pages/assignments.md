Reading Response 1 in "Zen" Gardens
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

"Zen" is probably one of the most overused Asian words in English-language writings. People often apply the concept very sloppily to any Japanese art or anything "Japanesey." The notion of "Zen Arts" was first popularized by critics such as D. Suzuki. But it is a rather vague term that can apply to a number of different types of artistic expression. The "dry landscape garden" (karesansui) of the Muromachi and the rustic tea garden of the Momoyama are both considered Zen-influenced styles of garden architecture, and yet they are very different. So how can they both be "Zen"?

Briefly describe how the karesansui and the rustic tea garden are influenced by Zen. What are some of the aesthetic characteristics associated with Zen, and how are they revealed in these two garden forms? What qualities of Zen does each embody? Which do you prefer and why?

Discuss with reference to:

1. The aesthetic ideals of "austere elegance," the "beauty of empty space."
2. The 7 characteristics of Zen arts identified by Shinichi Hisamatsu.
3. The aesthetic of "wabi."
4. The idea that "tea and Zen have the same taste."

Reading Response 2 in Material and Cultural World of Chinese Literati
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}
Shen Fu's "Six Records of a Life Adrift" is also known as the "Six Records of a Floating Life," the term "floating life" being a reference to Buddhist notions of impermanence, transience, and the illusory nature of the material world and our human existence. How are these ideas further articulated in the text? How are the ideals or values of Confucianism reflected (or rejected) in the text? What insights can you gain from the selected reading about family relationships and gender roles? About Shen's attitude toward education and professional options?

Reading Response 3 in Lady Hyegyoung's Dilemma
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Describe Lady Hyegyoung's dilemma in terms of Confucianism.   
Confucianism emphasizes:   
Subject’s loyalty to King;   
Husband-wife relationship;   
Parent-child relationship.

Confucianism also prescribes the "3 Followings" for women:   
Daughter follows father;   
Wife follows husband;   
Widow follows son.

Describe her choices and decision to live in the wake of tragedy in terms of Confucianism.   
Was the act of writing her memoirs an attempt to justify her choice?
